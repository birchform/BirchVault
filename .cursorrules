## Desktop App Development

### Changelog Management
When editing any files in `apps/desktop/`:
1. **Check** `apps/desktop/CHANGELOG.md` to see current version and changes
2. **Update** the changelog if:
   - Adding a new feature → Add under `### Added`
   - Fixing a bug → Add under `### Fixed`
   - Changing existing behaviour → Add under `### Changed`
   - Removing something → Add under `### Removed`
3. **If editing something already listed** in the current version's changelog, update that entry instead of adding a duplicate
4. Keep entries concise but descriptive

### Version Bumping
- When ready to release, update version in `apps/desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
- Add a new version section to the changelog with the release date
- Build with `pnpm tauri build` from `apps/desktop/`
- Tag and push: `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`
